    <p class="mt-2">It's like getting paid just for owning the stock! Not all companies pay dividends.</p>
  `,
  
  'volatility': `
    <p><strong>Volatility</strong> measures how much a stock's price jumps around.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">High volatility = wild swings (risky but potentially profitable)</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Low volatility = steady and predictable (safer for beginners)</p>
  `,
  
  'diversification': `
    <p><strong>Diversification</strong> means spreading money across different investments.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Don't put all eggs in one basket! Own 3-5+ stocks in different industries to reduce risk.</p>

  'bear-market': `

  `,
  
  'limit-order': `
    <p>A <strong>Limit Order</strong> lets you set the exact price to buy/sell.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Trade only happens if price reaches your limit. More control, but might not execute.</p>
  `,
  
  'market-order': `

  `,
  
  'stop-loss': `
    <p>A <strong>Stop Loss</strong> automatically sells if price drops to a set level.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Protects from big losses! Set it 10-15% below buy price as a safety net.</p>
  `,
  
  'average-cost': `
    <p><strong>Average Cost</strong> is the average price you paid for all shares of a stock.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">If you bought at different prices, this averages them out. Helps track profit/loss.</p>
  `,
  
  'gain-loss': `
    <p><strong>Gain/Loss</strong> shows how much you've made or lost on an investment.</p>
    <p class="mt-2"><em>Unrealized</em> = still own it (paper profit)</p>
    <p class="mt-1"><em>Realized</em> = sold it (actual profit/loss)</p>
