  etfPurchase: "Smart choice with an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)! ETFs automatically give you exposure to many companies at once, making diversification easier. They're often recommended for beginners.",
  
  firstSell: "You've completed your first sell order! Knowing when to sell is just as important as knowing when to buy. Practice helps you develop confidence in both decisions.",
  
  profitTaken: (data) => `Nice work taking a profit! You made $${data.profit} on ${data.symbol}. Remember, in real investing, profits are only 'realized' when you sell. This is how wealth building works!`,

  marketVolatility: "Notice how stock prices change? This is normal market behavior. Real markets can be more volatile! Use this practice time to get comfortable with price movements."
